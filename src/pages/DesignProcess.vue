          A little more detail on the design process I've been involved with
          recently. Poverty Solutions was one of my last design projects at
          Michigan Creative. The client wanted a more modern platform for their
          data and research.

          Project Background
        </h2>
        <p>
          Poverty Solutions, entering its fifth year, is building on the
          successes of the past, adding additional programming and accompanying
          marketing materials. Recognizing the initiative’s evolution and
          growth, and that the resources and information presented should be
          easy to access by a broad audience, Poverty Solutions needed to
          refresh their website to evolve the communication of its mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initiative wanted a site that streamlined and branded Poverty
          Solutions’ communication tools and resources, communicate the value of
          Poverty Solutions’ outcomes, tell the story of how Poverty Solutions
          is contributing to the prevention and alleviation of poverty, and
          drive awareness of Poverty Solutions and its mission.

          Beginning the design process
        </h2>
        <p>
          Prior to this point in the process there have been content
          inventories, initial content strategy planning, and a new site map
          created. Eventually the concepts were informed by the research, user
          and audience input, stakeholder discovery, and strategy. Discovery
          meetings are when I ask questions about their competitors and design
          preferences/likes. Additionally during this phase, the entire team was
          heavily engaged to ensure the designs support the goals and take
          advantage of best practices in usability, design, and accessibility.

          Wireframes

        <p>
          Before I get too deep in the design process, there's the matter of
          what elements go where to best execute their goals. This process is
          highly collaborative with both the internal team and the stakeholders.
          I like to use Invision's Freehand tool for this. It allows for
          realtime collaboration and creation. And for client to move around
          elements on their own should they be so inspired. What I love about
          this stage is that the very beginnings of a design system and
          component library start to emerge. Optimization for mobile is also
          worked out.

          Initial designs
        </h2>
        <p>
          During the wireframing process, I usually start to think that I have a
          pretty good idea what a version will look like. I start with type
          studies. For me, it all begins with the typography. I'll try to use
          actual headlines and copy from the existing site to get a sense of the
          tone. I'll roughly work out some of hierarchy and type scale at this
          point as well. Then it's on to reviewing existing assets (photos,
          infographic, etc.) and moodboarding the overall expression of the
          imagery. I'm also thinking about contrasting choices for a second
          version during this portion. Since this is a U-M property, the color
          palette is set. I do have to think about how strongly it should be
          applied, what accents should I focus on, and what are the most accessible combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I'm satisfied that the typography and imagery have some rules and
          a look, I start layouts. The wireframes help inform the order in which
          elements should appear and their importance. The challenge I try to
          give myself is creating an experience that gives seemless flow from
          one element to another. I've played music since I was eight years old,
          so I tend think about design and layouts as having rhythm in a sense.
          There are beats, stops, parts that speed up or slow down. Does the
          rhythm makes sense on all screens? If not, how do I optimize or change
          the design across screens? I'm also checking the design's accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, based on all the research, IA, wireframes, and interal feedback
          I've come to a couple of designs ready to present. The client picks a
          direction and we move on to refining it and adding more layouts,
          components, and other visuals.

          Refining, additions, and prototyping
        </h2>
        <p>
          This phase, for me, is the most critical part. We're not only fleshing
          out the rest of the wires, we're thinking about interactions,
          transitions, and animations. In addition to incorporating feedback,
          I'm prototyping for

          and

        </p>
        <p>Throughout the process, I'm advocating for the very best accessible and empathic user experience and design. Accessibility and empathy benefit all.</p>
