              >Along with traditional print and digital design, I am a front end developer with experience using VueJS, React, a number of static site generators such as Hugo and 11ty, and Jamstack in general.  I strive to write accessible and semantic HTML and CSS. While I have extensive experience with SASS, I find myself lately using PostCSS and a utility-first CSS philosophy. My use of javascript is mainly presentational and&mdash;when I do write it&mdash;it's of the vanilla variety.</p>
