Along with traditional print and digital design, I am a front end developer with experience using VueJS, React, a number of static site generators such as Hugo and 11ty, and with Jamstack in general. I also build out custom CMSes using a headless CMS called Netlify CMS and make custom Wordpress themes with custom React components for Gutenberg. I've built a custom Drupal theme that was more fun that I originally thought! I strive to write accessible and semantic HTML and CSS. While I have extensive experience with SASS, I find myself lately using vanilla CSS with PostCSS and a utility-first CSS philosophy. I do still love SASS. My use of javascript is mainly presentational but have been doing more with Firebase lately which requires some heavy javascripting to create and interact with objects.
