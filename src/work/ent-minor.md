## Project duration

November 2020 - January 2021

## Role

Designer.

## Background
A very quick turnaround for a new site containing information for a cross-discpline minor. The site features quite a lot of whitespace to aid in comprehension and focus. Some of the information is dense so it was critical to manage elements appropriately.
