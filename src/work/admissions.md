## Project duration

October 2019 - July 2020

## Role

Designer.

## Background

A complete redesign of U-M's Undergraduate Admissions site. There was so much work and effort before I picked it up. The design process for this went so smoothly that it feels minuscule in comparison to everyone elses' work. Another site we're very proud of.
