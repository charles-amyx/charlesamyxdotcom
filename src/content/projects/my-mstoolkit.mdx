# My MSToolkit

When the University of Michigan approached me about creating a digital resource for people living with Multiple Sclerosis, I knew this would be more than just another web project. This was an opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives through thoughtful design and development.

## Understanding the Challenge

The more we dove into the project, the more we realized how unique our approach needed to be. We weren't just building a website – we were creating a tool that needed to work for people during their best and most challenging moments. Some users might visit the site during periods of limited mobility or vision. Others might need to navigate entirely by keyboard or screen reader. And everyone needed to understand complex medical information without feeling overwhelmed.

## Learning from the MS Community

What made this project special was how much we learned directly from the MS community. Instead of making assumptions, we sat down with patients and listened to their experiences. We watched how they used different devices and interfaces. We learned about how their symptoms could change from day to day, and how that affected their ability to use digital tools.

## Bringing Ideas to Life

This project pushed me to explore new technical territories, particularly in animation. I had always wanted to work with Lottie animations, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. But we had to be thoughtful about it. Each animation needed to serve a purpose – helping explain complex concepts without being distracting or overwhelming.

I spent hours in After Effects, creating storyboards and animations that would later become lightweight, scalable Lottie files. Each animation went through multiple rounds of testing with our MS focus group. We added pause controls, adjusted speeds, and made sure everything worked seamlessly with screen readers.

## From Paper to Pixels

One of our biggest challenges was transforming existing print materials into engaging digital content. We had workbooks, worksheets, and reading materials that needed to work just as well on a screen as they did on paper. This wasn't just about copying and pasting – it was about reimagining how these resources could work in a digital space.

We turned static worksheets into interactive forms that saved progress. Dense text documents became digestible, well-spaced content with clear hierarchy. And importantly, everything could still be printed if needed, maintaining that crucial bridge between digital and physical resources.

## Making a Difference

The real reward came when we started hearing back from users. People with MS were telling us how much easier it was to access and understand their medical information. Families talked about feeling more equipped to support their loved ones. Healthcare providers appreciated having a reliable resource to share with their patients.

But beyond the positive feedback, we were seeing real engagement with the educational materials. The interactive worksheets were being used regularly. The animations were helping people understand complex medical concepts. The site was doing exactly what we hoped it would – making life a little bit easier for people living with MS.

## Looking Back

My MSToolkit stands out in my career as a project that truly embodied why I love what I do. It reminded me that web development isn't just about writing code or creating designs – it's about using these skills to make a positive impact in people's lives.

The project set a new standard for how I approach accessibility in my work. It showed me that true accessibility isn't just a checklist of technical requirements – it's about understanding and designing for real human needs. Every project since has benefited from these lessons.
