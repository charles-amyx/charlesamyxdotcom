# Entrepreneurship Minor

The Entrepreneurship Minor website was a focused project for Michigan Ross, aimed at providing clear information about their cross-disciplinary program. With a tight timeline, the challenge was to present dense academic information in an accessible and engaging way.

## Design Approach

The design strategy centered on using whitespace strategically to improve readability and comprehension. Given the academic nature of the content, including course requirements, eligibility criteria, and program details, careful attention was paid to visual hierarchy and information architecture.

## Key Features

- Clean, minimalist design that puts content first
- Strategic use of whitespace to break up dense information
- Clear navigation structure for different user groups
- Mobile-responsive layout for on-the-go access

## Outcome

The resulting site successfully balances academic professionalism with modern design principles. The generous use of whitespace and careful typography choices helps students easily find and understand the information they need about the entrepreneurship minor program.
