# DEI Year Four Progress Report

The University of Michigan's Year Four Progress Report represented a significant shift in how the institution shared its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion achievements. For the first time, we moved from a traditional PDF format to a fully digital experience, making the comprehensive report more accessible and engaging for all stakeholders.

## The Challenge

Converting a detailed institutional report into an engaging digital format presented several challenges:
- Maintaining the academic rigor while improving readability
- Creating an information architecture that made complex data easily navigable
- Ensuring the platform could handle extensive content without sacrificing performance
- Meeting strict accessibility requirements for a diverse university audience

## Technical Implementation

The project pushed me to explore modern WordPress development practices. The tech stack included:

- WordPress with Sage theme framework for robust content management
- Advanced Custom Fields for flexible content structuring
- Roots stack for modern development workflow
- AlpineJS for lightweight interactivity
- TailwindCSS for maintainable styling
- Custom CI/CD pipeline for deployment to ITS servers

## Design Approach

The design focused on creating an open, airy presentation that would make dense institutional content more approachable:

- Strategic use of whitespace to improve readability
- Clear typography hierarchy for better content scanning
- Responsive layouts that work across all device sizes
- Interactive elements to engage users with the data
- Accessible color schemes and contrast ratios

## Key Features

- Interactive data visualizations
- Responsive navigation system
- Print-friendly formatting
- Accessible to screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Fast-loading pages despite content complexity

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided valuable insights into modern WordPress development:
- First hands-on experience with the Roots/Sage ecosystem
- Implementation of new deployment methods for university servers
- Balancing modern development practices with institutional requirements

## Impact

The digital transformation of the DEI report significantly improved its reach and usability:
- Increased accessibility for all university stakeholders
- Improved ability to share and reference specific sections
- Better engagement with report content through interactive elements
- Reduced environmental impact by eliminating printed reports
