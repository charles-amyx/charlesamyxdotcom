This year we've moved the report in its entirety online. An open and airy design presents the year four's achivements in an easy understand format. The tech stack behind the site is [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), Sage, Advanced Custom Fields, Sage ACF directives, Roots, AlpineJS, and TailwindCSS. This was the first time using Roots/Sage and a new method of deploying the site to ITS servers. I learned that I have so much more to learn. I would use this tech stack again, if I had to use Wordpress again.
