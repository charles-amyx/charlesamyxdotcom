# The 2030 Project

As a Senior Web Designer at Cornell University, I led the development of The 2030 Project website - a critical initiative focused on climate change solutions. The project required a platform that could effectively communicate complex climate research and engage diverse audiences, from researchers to policy makers and the general public.

## The Challenge

The 2030 Project needed a digital platform that could:
- Present complex climate research in an accessible way
- Facilitate collaboration between researchers across disciplines
- Engage multiple audience types with varying levels of scientific knowledge
- Maintain high performance while delivering rich content
- Meet strict accessibility requirements

## The Process

The development process focused on creating a fast, accessible, and maintainable website. We chose a modern tech stack including 11ty for static site generation, Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity, and Tailwind CSS for styling. This combination allowed us to create a performant site that could be easily maintained by Cornell's team.

## Technical Implementation

The technical architecture was built with several key considerations:

- **Static Site Generation**: Used 11ty to generate static pages for optimal performance and security
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Implemented with Alpine.js for interactive features while maintaining core functionality without JavaScript
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
- **Content Management**: Integrated with Drupal for content editing while maintaining the static architecture
- **Deployment**: Implemented CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Development Approach

The development process was iterative and collaborative:

1. **Architecture Planning**: Carefully planned the site architecture to ensure scalability
2. **Component Development**: Created reusable components for consistent design and easier maintenance
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented lazy loading, image optimization, and efficient caching strategies
4. **Testing and QA**: Conducted thorough testing across devices and browsers
5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the Cornell team

## Project Outcomes

The final website successfully met Cornell's goals by:
- Providing a fast, accessible platform for climate research communication
- Creating an intuitive interface for content discovery
- Implementing a sustainable development approach that the university team could maintain
- Meeting all accessibility requirements
- Achieving excellent performance metrics

The site serves as a crucial tool in Cornell's mission to address climate change, facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration across the university and beyond.
