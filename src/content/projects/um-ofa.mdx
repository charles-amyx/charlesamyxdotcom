## Background

A complete redesign of U-M's financial aid site, developed in parallel with the Undergraduate Admissions redesign. As a key sub-unit within the admissions ecosystem, the Office of Financial Aid needed to maintain its own distinct identity while clearly belonging to the broader U-M admissions experience.

## Design Approach

Leveraging the Freight typeface family established in the Admissions design system, we created a distinct visual identity that:
- Maintained clear visual connection to Admissions while avoiding direct replication
- Used specific weights and styles from the Freight family to create a unique voice
- Balanced the need for clarity in complex financial information with visual appeal

## Implementation

Working closely with stakeholders and development teams, we:
- Adapted the component library to meet Financial Aid's specific content needs
- Optimized the information architecture to help students and families navigate complex financial aid processes
- Maintained consistency with U-M's broader digital ecosystem while serving OFA's unique audience

The result was a site that clearly belonged to the U-M family while maintaining its own distinct presence, demonstrating the flexibility and strength of our typography-driven design system.
