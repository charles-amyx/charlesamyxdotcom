# Ad Hoc Website Redesign

As Senior Designer in the Communications team at Ad Hoc, I led a comprehensive overhaul of the company's website infrastructure, focusing on both technical performance and user experience improvements.

## The Challenge

The existing Jekyll-based website faced several critical issues:
- Extremely slow build times (27 minutes) hampering rapid iterations
- Legacy codebase that was difficult to maintain
- Limited flexibility for content creators
- Performance bottlenecks affecting user experience

## The Solution

We undertook a complete platform migration, moving from Jekyll to Hugo, while implementing modern development practices and performance optimizations.

## Technical Implementation

The new architecture was built with several key improvements:

- **Framework Migration**: Transitioned from Jekyll to Hugo for improved build performance
- **Modern Styling**: Implemented Tailwind CSS for maintainable, utility-first styling
- **Interactive Elements**: Added Alpine.js for lightweight client-side interactions
- **Build Optimization**: Engineered new build processes reducing deploy time by 96%
- **Content Management**: Created an improved content workflow for the communications team

## Development Process

The migration was executed in phases to ensure continuous site availability:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Analyzed existing codebase and identified optimization opportunities
2. **Architecture Planning**: Designed new Hugo-based architecture with improved build processes
3. **Content Migration**: Systematically transferred and validated existing content
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented lazy loading, image optimization, and caching strategies
5. **Testing and Validation**: Conducted thorough testing across devices and browsers

## Custom Features

Several custom features were developed to enhance the site's functionality:

- **Blog Category System**: Built a custom filtering system for blog posts using vanilla JavaScript
- **Progressive Web App**: Implemented PWA capabilities for mobile installation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added automated performance tracking and reporting
- **Build Pipeline**: Aided in creating efficient CI/CD workflows for automated deployments

## Results

The project achieved significant improvements:

- **Build Time**: Reduced from 27 minutes to under 1 minute
- **Developer Experience**: Improved code maintainability and deployment processes
- **User Experience**: Enhanced site performance and mobile accessibility
- **Content Management**: Streamlined content creation and publishing workflow

The new website serves as a modern, performant platform that better represents Ad Hoc's commitment to technical excellence in civic technology.
