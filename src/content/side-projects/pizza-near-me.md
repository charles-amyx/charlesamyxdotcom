## About This Project

Originally developed as a React Native iOS application with a companion React web app. While the iOS version never made it to the App Store due to infrastructure maintenance considerations, the web version serves as a practical tool for pizza discovery.

## Technical Details

Built using a dual-platform approach:

- React Native for iOS native application
- React for the progressive web application
- Browser and native Geolocation APIs
- Google Places API for restaurant data
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Cross-platform state management
- Native iOS UI components

## Features

- Location-based search using device geolocation
- Real-time distance calculations
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Restaurant details including:
  - Operating hours
  - Distance from current location
  - Contact information
  - Ratings and reviews
- Responsive layout that adapts to both mobile and desktop views

## Development Journey

The project began as an iOS application built with React Native, aiming to provide a native experience for pizza discovery. While the iOS version was completed, the decision to focus on the web version was made to reduce ongoing maintenance overhead and provide broader accessibility across all devices.
