## About This Project

I've been a photographer since receiving my first camera in my freshman year of high school. And I've been using those skills both professionally and personally ever since.

I admire many zen poets, including Ikkyu. A line from one of his poems was the catalyst for this ongoing photography project. If you can call it that; I'm real loosy-goosy. Anyway, Ikkyu attained enlightenment on a boat listening to a crow while meditating. Maybe you or I will be struck in the same way someday?

This place is a part of my daily meditation. I'm not worried about taking perfect photos; I'm being present.
