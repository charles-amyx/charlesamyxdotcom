## Project duration

April 2018 - November 2028

## Role

Designer, front end, and WordPress development.

Probably one of the most fulfilling projects I've worked on. The site was tested with a focus comprised of individuals with MS. The site was a resounding success which validated some of the above and beyond accessibilty we focused on. It was also a lot of fun working on the animated icons. This site was the first time I've used Lottie, a library that renders After Effects animations for the web.
