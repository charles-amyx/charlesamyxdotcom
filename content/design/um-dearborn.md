Rather than go through a full redesign process, UM-Dearborn opted to conduct a visual refresh of their existing components using the same markup. An upgrade to their typography really went a long way for them.

## Project duration

February 2019 - November 2019

## Role

Designer and developer (styleguide and HTML/CSS/JS prototypes of components).
